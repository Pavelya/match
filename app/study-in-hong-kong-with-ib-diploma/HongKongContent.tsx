  {
    question: 'Is the IB Diploma recognized for university admission in Hong Kong?',
    answer:
      'Yes. The IB Diploma is widely recognized by all eight UGC-funded universities and most self-financing institutions in Hong Kong SAR. IB students apply through the Non-JUPAS (direct admission) route. Each university sets its own minimum IB score requirements, which typically range from 24 to 30+ depending on the institution and programme.',

  },
  {
    question: 'How do IB students apply to Hong Kong universities?',
    answer:
      "IB students apply through the Non-JUPAS route, which means submitting applications directly to each university's online application system. JUPAS is reserved for local students with the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE). There is no centralized platform — you must apply separately to each institution you are interested in.",

  },
  {
    question: 'What IB score do I need for Hong Kong universities?',
    answer:
      'There is no single score requirement — it varies by university and programme. As a general guide: HKU and CUHK typically expect 30+ points for most programmes, with competitive programmes (Medicine, Dentistry) requiring 40+. HKUST generally requires 28+ points. Programme-specific subject requirements at Higher Level may also apply.',

  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to speak Chinese to study in Hong Kong?',
    answer:
      "Not for most programmes. English is the primary medium of instruction at Hong Kong's UGC-funded universities, and many programmes are taught entirely in English. Some programmes — particularly in Chinese studies, education, or social work — may require Chinese language proficiency. English proficiency is typically demonstrated through IB English courses (Grade 4+ in English A or English B HL; Grade 5+ in English B SL).",

  {
    question: 'Are there tuition fees for international IB students in Hong Kong?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Non-local students at UGC-funded universities pay higher tuition fees than local students. Tuition fees for non-local undergraduate students are set by individual institutions. Many universities offer entrance scholarships for outstanding IB students, with some covering full tuition fees for students achieving IB scores of 40 or above.',

                Hong Kong universities assess IB results{' '}
                <strong>directly using the IB 45-point scale</strong>. There is no official
                conversion to the local HKDSE grading system. Universities evaluate your total IB
                score, individual subject grades (especially at Higher Level), and any
                programme-specific subject requirements.
