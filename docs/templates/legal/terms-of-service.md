These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service, regardless of their role on the platform.


## 2. Description of Service

**IB Match** is a university program matching and guidance platform built for the International Baccalaureate (IB) community. The Service provides:

- **For University Agents**: Program listing management, anonymized student match analytics, and recruitment insight tools.
- **For Platform Administrators**: Platform-wide management, user administration, content oversight, and system configuration.

> **Important:** The Service is provided for informational and guidance purposes only. Match scores and recommendations are estimates and **do not guarantee admission** to any program. Program information is sourced from universities but may not always be complete or current.


## 3. User Eligibility

- You are at least **13 years of age**
- You are capable of forming a binding contract
- You will provide accurate and complete information
- You will maintain the security of your account credentials


## 4. User Accounts

### 4.1. Account Creation

- **Students** may create accounts by self-registration using email (magic link) or Google login.
- **IB Coordinators**, **University Agents**, and **Platform Administrators** can only create accounts through a secure **invitation process**. These roles cannot self-register.

### 4.2. Account Responsibilities

When you create or receive an account, you are responsible for:

- Maintaining the **confidentiality** of your account credentials
- All activities that occur under your account
- Notifying us immediately of any unauthorized use

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms.


## 5. User Roles and Permissions

The Service supports distinct user roles, each with specific permissions and responsibilities:

### 5.1. Students

Students use the platform to discover university programs that match their IB academic profile. Students may:

- Create and manage their academic profile (courses, grades, levels, TOK/EE)
- Set preferred fields of study and geographic preferences
- View personalized program recommendations and match breakdowns
- Search and filter all listed programs and universities
- Save programs for later review
- Optionally link to an IB school on the platform, which grants their school's coordinators access to their academic profile for guidance purposes

### 5.2. IB Coordinators

IB Coordinators are school representatives who guide students through university admissions. Coordinators are authorized by their IB school and are subject to the following terms:

- **Authority**: By accepting a coordinator invitation, you represent and warrant that you are authorized by your IB school to act in this capacity on the platform.
- **Student Data Access**: Coordinators may view and, where appropriate, edit academic data (courses, grades, match results) for students linked to their school. This access is granted solely for the purpose of providing university application guidance.
- **Consent**: Coordinators acknowledge that students voluntarily link to a school, and students may unlink at any time, which revokes coordinator access to their data.
- **Responsible Use**: Coordinators must ensure the accuracy of any student data they edit and must not use the platform or student data for any purpose beyond university guidance.
- **Invitation Rights**: Coordinators may invite other coordinators and students to their school's workspace, subject to any limits determined by the school's access level.
- **Data Deletion**: Coordinators may submit a request for deletion of their school's data from the platform. Such requests are subject to review by Platform Administrators.

### 5.3. University Agents

University Agents are representatives who manage their institution's program listings. Agents are subject to the following terms:

- **Authority**: By accepting an agent invitation, you represent and warrant that you are authorized by your university to manage its presence on the platform.
- **Program Accuracy**: Agents are responsible for ensuring that all program information (requirements, descriptions, links) is accurate and kept up to date.
- **Data Access**: Agents may view only **anonymized, aggregate statistics** about student matches with their programs. Agents do not have access to individual student identities or personal data.
- **Invitation Rights**: Agents may invite other agents to their university's workspace.
- **Data Deletion**: Agents may submit a request for deletion of their university and its programs from the platform. Such requests are subject to review by Platform Administrators.

### 5.4. Platform Administrators

Platform Administrators are internal team members responsible for operating and maintaining the platform. Administrators have full access to manage users, content, schools, universities, and system configuration.


## 6. Subscriptions and Payments

### 6.1. Free Access

- **IB Students**: The Service is always free for students.
- **University Agents**: Core features are free for university agents.

### 6.2. School Access Levels

IB Schools have one of two access levels:

- **VIP Schools**: Schools admitted to our early adopter program receive full, unrestricted access to all coordinator features at no cost. All coordinators at a VIP school inherit this full access.
- **Regular Schools**: A freemium model applies. Coordinators at Regular schools can see and use basic features for free. Premium features (unlimited student invitations, advanced analytics, bulk export, additional coordinator invitations) are visible but locked behind a paid subscription upgrade.

### 6.3. Payment Terms

- Subscriptions apply to **Regular schools only** and are managed at the **school level**, not per individual coordinator. All coordinators at a subscribing school share the same full access.
- Payments are processed securely through **Stripe**. IB Match does not store credit card numbers or payment details directly.
- Subscription details, including pricing, renewal, and cancellation terms, are presented at the time of purchase.
- Upon cancellation, the school reverts to freemium access. Existing data is retained.

### 6.4. Refunds

Refund requests are handled on a case-by-case basis. Please contact us at legal@ibmatch.com for refund inquiries.
