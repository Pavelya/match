## How Australia Recognizes the IB Diploma

Australia recognizes the **International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma** as an accepted senior secondary qualification for entry to Australian universities.

Admission decisions are made by universities, often using state-based admissions centres that compare IB results with ATAR-based applicants.

## Do IB Students Get an ATAR in Australia?
