# Study in Spain with the IB Diploma

### Official University Admission Guide for IB Students (2026)

**Last updated for the 2026 intake**

This guide explains **how the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma is used for university admission in Spain**, using only official public sources. It is written exclusively for **IB Diploma students and IB Coordinators**.

---

## How Spain Recognizes the IB Diploma

Spain officially recognizes the **International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma** as equivalent to the Spanish *Título de Bachiller*. This equivalence allows IB students to access Spanish higher education without completing the national Spanish Bachillerato.

This recognition is established in Spanish education regulations published in the **Spanish Official State Gazette**, Spain’s official legal bulletin.

The accreditation process is administered by **UNEDassis**, the only public body authorized to validate international secondary school diplomas for university access in Spain.

## Do IB Students Need to Take Selectividad?

**No.**

IB students are **exempt from the general phase** of the Spanish university entrance examination (EvAU / Selectividad) due to the official equivalence of the IB Diploma.

This exemption is confirmed through UNEDassis accreditation and applies nationwide.

## How IB Scores Are Converted in Spain (0–14 System)

Spain uses a **two-step scoring system** regulated by the **Ministry of Universities**, with score conversion performed by UNEDassis.

---

### Base University Access Score (0–10)

Your total IB Diploma score (24–45 points) is converted into a **Base University Access Score** on a 0–10 scale.

| IB Points | Base Score |
| --------- | ---------- |
| 42–45     | 10.0       |
| 40        | ~9.5       |
| 36        | ~8.4       |
| 30        | ~6.8       |

```
