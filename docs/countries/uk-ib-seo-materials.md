# Study in the UK with the IB Diploma

### Official University Admission Guide for IB Students (2026)

**Last updated for the 2026 intake**

This guide explains how the **International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma** is used for university admission in the **United Kingdom** using only **official UCAS and UK government sources**.

---

## How the UK Recognizes the IB Diploma

The United Kingdom accepts the **International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma** as a valid Level 3 qualification that allows applicants to apply for undergraduate study through the UK admissions system.

Most UK universities list IB entry requirements alongside A-levels and other qualifications in their UCAS course listings.

**Official/source foundational info:**

* UCAS administers UK undergraduate admissions (charity/limited company managing applications) — including equivalent treatment of international qualifications such as the IB. ([Wikipedia][2])

---

## Do IB Students Apply Through UCAS?

**Yes.**

IB students must apply for undergraduate degree courses through **UCAS**, the official centralized platform used by virtually all UK universities and higher-education providers.

UCAS allows students to:

* apply to up to five courses
* submit predicted grades
* receive conditional and unconditional offers

**Official source:**

* UCAS international support and key admissions topics. ([UCAS][3])

---

## UK Entry Requirements for IB Students

UK universities set their own **entry requirements for IB students**.

Typically, offers are expressed using:

* total IB points (e.g., 32–40+)
* specific Higher Level subject criteria
* additional admissions test requirements for competitive subjects

There is **no single government-mandated minimum** for IB scores; requirements are published per course on UCAS and university sites.

---

## Is There a National IB Grade Conversion in the UK?

**No.**

The UK does not operate a **national grade conversion table** for the IB equivalent to A-Levels. Instead, universities interpret IB results as Level 3 qualifications and may express offers in **UCAS Tariff points** if they choose, but this is institution-specific.

**Official context:**

* UCAS Tariff exists to map international qualifications (including the IB) into a common points framework. ([Wikipedia][4])

---

## Language Requirements for IB Students

**Yes, English language proficiency is required.**

UK universities define their own English language requirements for admission. Many accept IB English at an appropriate level, but some will require an additional English proficiency test depending on the institution and program.

International students must also meet the **UK student visa English requirements** as set by the UK government.

**Official sources:**

* UK visa English requirement guidance. [https://www.gov.uk/student-visa/knowledge-of-english](https://www.gov.uk/student-visa/knowledge-of-english)

---

## Student Visa Requirements (International IB Students)

International IB students **require a UK Student visa** to study in the UK.

General requirements include:

* Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) from a UK university
* Proof of English language ability
* Sufficient funds evidence
* Valid passport

**Official source:**

* Student visa requirements, UK government. [https://www.gov.uk/student-visa](https://www.gov.uk/student-visa)

---

## Public vs Private Universities in the UK

Most UK universities are publicly funded higher-education providers that participate in the UCAS admissions cycle.

Private and specialist providers also participate in UCAS, though some may have supplementary requirements.

UCAS admissions apply regardless of public or private status.

---

## Required Documents for IB Students

For UK UCAS applications, IB students typically need:

* Predicted IB grades
* Academic reference
* Personal statement (2026 changes may alter structure)
* Final IB results (after May exams)

Note: In 2026, UCAS transitions away from the traditional single personal-statement essay to structured questions focused on motivation and preparation. ([The Guardian][5])
