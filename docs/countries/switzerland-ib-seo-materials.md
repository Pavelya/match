# Study in Switzerland with the IB Diploma

### Official University Admission Guide for IB Students (2026)

**Last updated for the 2026 intake**

This guide explains **how the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma is used for admission to Swiss universities**, using only official Swiss higher-education and institutional sources.

Switzerland’s system is **decentralized**, meaning that universities determine their own admission policies for foreign qualifications, including the IB Diploma.

---

## How Switzerland Recognizes the IB Diploma

Swiss universities accept the **International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma** as a **foreign upper secondary school-leaving certificate** for university admission when it meets each institution’s academic criteria and subject requirements.

Swiss universities evaluate foreign qualifications individually within the framework of general university entry criteria outlined by **Swissuniversities**, the umbrella body for Swiss universities and coordination of admission policies. ([swissuniversities.ch][1])

---

## Do IB Students Need a Swiss Maturity?

**No.**

IB students do **not** need a Swiss *Maturität* (Swiss maturity certificate) to apply to Swiss universities. The IB Diploma is recognized as **equivalent to upper secondary school leaving** by universities and can be used to satisfy the basic admission entitlement and academic eligibility. ([anerkennung.swiss][2])

---

## University Admission Requirements in Switzerland

Swiss universities set **their own admission requirements** for foreign qualifications, including the IB Diploma. There is **no single national admission authority** for university entry; instead, each public university defines how IB results fulfill entry criteria. ([anerkennung.swiss][2])

For example, the **University of Basel** states that an upper secondary school-leaving certificate (such as the IB Diploma) is considered for bachelor’s studies and evaluated using the institution’s regulations. ([University of Basel][3])

---

## Subject and Score Expectations for IB Students

There is **no national IB score conversion table in Switzerland** like some other countries have. Instead:

* Universities often require a total of at least **32 out of 42 IB points** (excluding core points) for generic eligibility — a pattern seen across many Swiss university policies. ([University of Basel][3])
* Competitive programs (e.g., science/engineering) may stipulate **subject prerequisites** such as HL Mathematics or Natural Sciences, depending on the university. ([swissuniversities.ch][4])

Specific score expectations vary by institution and by degree program.

---

## Language Requirements for IB Students

**Yes — language proficiency is required.**

Since Swiss universities teach in **German, French, or English** depending on location and program:

* German-taught programs generally require **German proficiency** at an appropriate level set by the university (often B2 or C1 of CEFR). ([orientation.ch][5])
* French-taught programs generally require **French proficiency** (often B2 or better) as set by the institution. ([orientation.ch][5])
* Some English-taught programs are available and require **English proficiency** evidence (e.g., IELTS, TOEFL) as required by the university.

Language criteria are set by each university and must be met in addition to the IB academic requirements.

---

## Admission Exams and Selection Procedures

Swiss universities may apply **additional selection procedures** for competitive programs such as medicine or engineering:

* Some institutions require **entrance examinations** if academic credentials do not fully meet entry conditions. ([swissuniversities.ch][1])
* Others may require portfolio submissions for arts programs.

These are set by individual universities.

---

## Public vs Private Institutions for IB Students

### Public Universities

* Switzerland’s cantonal universities, ETH/EPFL, and other public institutions define their own admission rules for foreign qualifications. Admission criteria must be met for each program. ([swissuniversities.ch][1])

### Private Institutions

* Some private universities and international schools also accept the IB Diploma, but rules may vary significantly. Always check the specific institution’s official admissions information.

---

## Required Documents for IB Students

Typical requirements include:

* Official **IB Diploma certificate** (or predicted grades if applying before results)
* Academic transcripts showing subjects and level (HL/SL)
* Proof of **language proficiency** (German, French, or English, as required)
* Identification (passport)
* Any programme-specific materials (e.g., portfolio for arts)

Universities may require **certified translations** and attestations if original documents are not in the language of instruction.

---

## Application Timeline and Process

Switzerland does **not** operate a centralized application portal for all universities. Each institution has its **own application system and deadlines**:

* Most universities have a **fall intake (September)**.
* Deadlines and processes are published directly by the universities.
* Applicants should consult the official admissions page of the target university for exact dates and timelines.

Official guidance emphasizes applying **directly to each institution** for degree programs. ([anerkennung.swiss][2])
