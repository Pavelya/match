# Study in Germany with the IB Diploma

### Official University Admission Guide for IB Students (2026)

**Last updated for the 2026 intake**

This guide explains **how the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma is used for university admission in Germany**, using only official public sources. It is written exclusively for **IB Diploma students and IB Coordinators**.

---

## How Germany Recognizes the IB Diploma

Germany officially recognizes the **International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma** as a foreign secondary school qualification that can grant **direct university access (*Hochschulzugang*)**.

The legal recognition framework is defined by the **Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs (KMK)** and published in the national Anabin database.

**Official sources:**

* [https://www.kmk.org](https://www.kmk.org)
* [https://anabin.kmk.org](https://anabin.kmk.org)

---

## Do IB Students Need Studienkolleg?

**Usually no.**

IB students **do not need to attend Studienkolleg** if their IB Diploma subject combination meets Germany’s official university entrance requirements.

If the required IB subjects are **missing**, Studienkolleg may be required before university admission.

**Official sources:**

Germany applies **nationwide subject requirements** for IB-based university access.

The IB Diploma must include:

* **Two languages**
* **Mathematics** (AA or AI, depending on field)
* **One natural science** (Biology, Chemistry, or Physics)
* **One social science or humanities subject**

Certain fields (Medicine, Engineering, Natural Sciences) require **specific Higher Level (HL) subjects**.

**Official sources:**

Some German universities require IB students to apply through **uni-assist**, which:

* Issues a **VPD (Vorprüfungsdokumentation)**

uni-assist applies **Anabin / KMK rules**, but does not define them.
Universities make the final admission decision.
