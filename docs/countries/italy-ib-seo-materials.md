Below is the **Italy version**, mirroring the Spain document exactly where possible, but replacing **UNEDassis / Selectividad / 0–14 system** with **CIMEA / Dichiarazione di Valore / Italian admission rules**.

# Study in Italy with the IB Diploma

### Official University Admission Guide for IB Students (2026)

**Last updated for the 2026 intake**

This guide explains **how the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma is used for university admission in Italy**, using only official public sources. It is written exclusively for **IB Diploma students and IB Coordinators**.

---

## How Italy Recognizes the IB Diploma

Italy officially recognizes the **International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma** as a valid foreign secondary school qualification for access to Italian higher education.

The legal recognition framework is defined by the **Italian Ministry of Universities and Research** and implemented through national credential evaluation procedures.

Universities rely on **CIMEA** (the official Italian information center for academic recognition) to verify foreign diplomas, including the IB.

**Official sources:**

* [https://www.mur.gov.it](https://www.mur.gov.it)
* [https://www.cimea.it](https://www.cimea.it)

---

## Do IB Students Need the Italian Maturità?

**No.**

IB students **do not need to obtain the Italian Maturità (Esame di Stato)** because the IB Diploma is recognized as an equivalent foreign secondary qualification.

Admission is granted through recognition and verification, not through completion of the Italian school-leaving exam.

**Official sources:**

* [https://www.mur.gov.it](https://www.mur.gov.it)
* [https://www.cimea.it](https://www.cimea.it)

---

## University Admission System in Italy

Italy does **not** use a centralized points-based admission system.

Admission decisions are made **per university and per program**, based on:

* Recognition of the IB Diploma
* Program-specific academic requirements
* Entrance exams (for restricted programs)

There is **no national IB score conversion table** equivalent to Spain’s 0–14 system.

**Official source:**

* [https://www.universitaly.it](https://www.universitaly.it)

---

## Entrance Exams and Restricted Programs

**Yes, many programs require entrance exams, even for IB students.**

Nationally restricted programs (*corsi a numero programmato*) include:

* Medicine and Surgery
* Dentistry
* Architecture
* Veterinary Medicine

These programs require passing national or university-level entrance exams, regardless of holding an IB Diploma.

**Official sources:**

* [https://www.mur.gov.it](https://www.mur.gov.it)

Language requirements are defined by each university.

## Public vs Private Universities for IB Students
